# Strategies - Smoke Test ...

* This is not a strategy per-se. More like a use-case
* Normally smoke-tests happen on the system level (during a deploy),
  but you could use PBT to do a unit-test low-level smoke-test by just
  calling the function 100 times with valid inputs and make sure it does
  not crash (in unexpected ways)

```elixir
check all term <- term() do 
  try do
    ListSort.quicksort(term) 
  rescue 
    FunctionClauseError -> :ok 
    other -> raise "raised unexpected exception: #{inspect(other)}" 
  else 
    term -> assert is_list(term)
  end
end
```
