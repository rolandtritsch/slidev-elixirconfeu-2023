# Strategies - Oracle ...

* Very good/effective for migration scenarios, were you have to
  replace an old implementation with a new implementation while
  preserving the old behavior
  * `function(value) == oracle(value)`
* Different can be any of language, service, endpoint, algorithm
  (faster), ...
* Can also cover: New implementation cannot be slower than old one?

```elixir
defmodule ListSortTest do use ExUnit.Case use
ExUnitProperties

  property "quicksort/1 correctly sorts lists" do
    check all list <- list_of(term()) do
      assert ListSort.quicksort(list) == :lists.sort(list)
    end 
  end 
end 
```
