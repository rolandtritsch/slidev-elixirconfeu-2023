# Introduction

## Motivation

* Testing: `input -> function -> output`
  * 3 tests: valid, invalid, edge-case
  * Good code coverage
* In 80% of the cases unit-testing will give you 80% of the value and
  that should be good enough!
* But in some cases you can test â€¦
  * `all(valid(input)) -> function -> output`
  * `all(invalid(input)) -> function -> output`
  * ... and check that the output is correct
  * ... and find/test the edge-cases 
* These tests are very valuable and low-maintenance
* Meet **property-based testing**!
