# Strategies - Using math :) ...

* In some cases the algorithm or calculation that produces the
  result/output has certain mathematical properties that can be
  tested, e.g. ...
  * `nth_prime(n) < nth_prime(n + 1)`
* These tests can take 2 (or more) values into consideration or just
  focus a property of one value, e.g. ...
  * `(sorted_list |> last()) > (sorted_list |> hd()) # are you still awake?`
* Do not test the algorithm by re-implementing the algorithm :)
