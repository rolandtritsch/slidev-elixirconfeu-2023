# Summary

## Main/Key Takeaways ...

* Do not “force” using PBT. It (only) works (well) for a subset of
  problem-domains (e.g. math problems, pure functions, ...)
* Do not look at it as an alternative, but more as a way to make your
  unit-testing more comprehensive, more complete and easier to
  maintain
* Do not “reverse” implement the generators and the properties. Look
  for “real” properties
