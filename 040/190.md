* The `check all` macro ...
* Runs 100 times (configurable with `max_runs`)
* Comprehension that supports generators (`<-`), 
  assignments (`=`) and filters (`boolean`)
* Body is doing the checking (with assert)

```elxir
check all list <- list_of(term()),
          list != [],
          member <- member_of(list) do
  assert member in list
end
```
